# Building the service

To build this service, you would need an up to date version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed.

## Install

Run

```
yarn
```

## Compile

The service is built using [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org), so you would have to compile to js. In development, it makes sense to have `typescript` automatically compile the files by adding a `--watch` flag to the command below.

```
yarn tsc
```

## Run the service locally.

Once the files are compiled, and althought typescript may emit compilation errors, it actually does still compile to the `/dist` folder.

## Update environment variables

Create a new `.env` file that is a copy of the `.env.example` file and insert the necessary strings

### Run using a debugger

If you're using [vsCode](https://vscode.visualstudio.com/), run the `Launch Program` debug config and you should be up and running on http://localhost:3005

### Run without debugger or vsCode

Run the following command

```
node bin/www
```

The service should be up and running on http://localhost:3005
